The RIGHT Lab is a multidisciplinary Responsible dIGital HumaniTies Lab, which is the first of its kind in the UK and seek to be a regional, national, and international leader in the field of Digital Humanities (DH). RIGHTâ€™s priorities will be to advance the field of DH, foster strong collaboration across UoW, and create tools, datasets and guidelines for ethical, responsible Natural Language Programming (NLP) focused DH.
